# Financial_Fraud_Detector
This AI tool uses a powerful Zephyr-7B language model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect potential financial fraud. Paste any financial statement, and it will instantly classify the fraud risk as High, Low, or Indeterminate.

An interactive tool that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze financial text and classify its potential for fraud. This project uses the `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` model to provide risk assessment.

## üìã Features

* **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses a 7-billion parameter language model for nuanced financial text analysis.
* **RAG for Context**: Enhances accuracy by retrieving relevant examples from a vector database before making a prediction.
* **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly Streamlit interface for easy text submission and analysis.
* **Example Loading**: Quickly load examples of suspicious and non-suspicious text to see the tool in action.
* **Command-Line Interface**: Retains the original CLI for backend testing and scripted use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1.  **Synthetic Data**: On first run, a synthetic dataset of fraudulent and non-fraudulent financial statements is generated.
2.  **Vector Store Creation**: This data is cleaned, processed, and stored in a `ChromaDB` vector store using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`. This vector store acts as the long-term memory for the RAG system.
3.  **User Query**: A user submits a piece of financial text through the UI.
4.  **Document Retrieval**: The system searches the ChromaDB store to find the most semantically similar financial statement (the "context").
5.  **LLM Prompting**: The user's text (as the "question") and the retrieved document (as the "context") are passed to the Zephyr-7B LLM using a specialized prompt.
6.  **Classification & Justification**: The LLM analyzes the information and classifies the text as "High Risk," "Low Risk," or "Indeterminate Risk," providing a brief justification for its decision based on the provided context.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is highly recommended for running the model locally.
* A Hugging Face account and an [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with at least `read` permissions.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up your Hugging Face Token:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add your token to it:
    ```
    HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="hf_YourAccessTokenHere"
    ```
    The application will load this token automatically.

3.  **Run the setup script:**
    This script will create a virtual environment, install all required dependencies, and download necessary NLTK data.
    ```bash
    bash setup.sh
    ```

### Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application in two ways:

1.  **With the Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
    Navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.

2.  **With the Command-Line Interface:**
    ```bash
    python fraud_detector_app.py
    ```
